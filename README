series.c, two_series.c and multi_series.c are provided that can
read one column, two columns or multiple columns from file.

They can be used as a general framework to be supplemented with
specific functions applied to time series data.  In all files a
comment "/* processing */" indicates where further actions on
the data can be added.  The example program series.c prints the
column that has been read, two_series.c multiplies two columns
line by line and multi_series.c shifts and rescales the data to
the interval [0,1].
